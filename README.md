- What is the average order value?
- What proportion of total sales does each category represent?
- What are the top selling items?
- What are the total orders by hour?
- What are the total sales by hour?
- What proportion of orders are via delivery versus pick up?

**Dashboard 2: Inventory**
- What is the total quantity for each ingredient? 
- What is the total cost for each ingredient? 
- What is the remaining inventory percentage for each ingredient?
- What is the list of ingredients to reorder based on the remaining inventory?
